[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findangles.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "angles", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "angles" with any
  of the following names:

    anglesConfig.cmake
    angles-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "angles" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "angles_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "angles"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
